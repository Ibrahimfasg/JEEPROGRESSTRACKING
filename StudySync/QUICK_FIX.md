# ðŸš¨ **Quick Fix for Netlify Deployment**

Your Netlify deployment is failing because it's trying to build the backend too. Here's the quickest fix:

## **Method 1: Update your GitHub repository**

1. **Download the updated netlify.toml file** from Replit:
   - Download as zip again from Replit
   - Extract and find the `netlify.toml` file

2. **Replace the file on GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on `netlify.toml`
   - Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file)
   - Replace the content with:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npx vite build"
  publish = "dist/public"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

3. **Commit the changes:**
   - Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**

4. **Redeploy on Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify â†’ Deploys â†’ Trigger deploy

## **Method 2: Quick Alternative**

If you want to start fresh:

1. **Delete your current repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a new one** with the same name
3. **Re-upload all files** from the newly downloaded zip
4. **Connect to Netlify again** with the updated configuration

The key issue was that Netlify was trying to build both frontend and backend, but we only need the frontend for static hosting.

Try Method 1 first - it's quicker!
